> Project #5 of [The Modern JavaScript
> Masterclass](https://github.com/codingcourses/modern-javascript-masterclass).

In this project, we will be building out a dashboard application with features: image background,
location, weather, quote, search bar, and customizable settings (i.e. display name, am/pm,
Fahrenheit/Celsius, default search engine). We will be learning about APIs, HTTP requests, and
building out a simple web server using Node and Express.

## Learning Goals

These are specific topics covered in this project:

- IPStack API: getting user's rough geographic location
- OpenWeatherMap API: getting location weather and forecast data
- Unsplash API: getting high-quality background images
- HTTP requests
- Creating a web server using Node, Express
- Client-server architecture
- Server-side caching (to make sure we don't go over our API limits)
- Environment variables
- Publishing to Heroku
